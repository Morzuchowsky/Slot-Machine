# Slot Machine: Text-based Game

Welcome to the Slot Machine text-based game, a simple yet exciting Python project that aims to replicate the thrill of a real-life slot machine.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `random` library

## How to Play

You can start the game by executing the main script from your terminal:

```bash
python slot_machine.py

The core gameplay mechanic is very straightforward - as a player, you will place a bet, following which symbols will be randomly generated. If the symbols align in a specific pattern, you will win a prize based on your initial bet and the pattern obtained.
